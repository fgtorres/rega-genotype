Git fetch github

Basics:

Fetch changes


Add 



Three examples of tools that can be constructed directly in the XML files (HAV and Nov).

Tulio-MacBook-Pro-Retina:~ tulio$ cd rega-genotype/


Tulio-MacBook-Pro-Retina:rega-genotype tulio$ git pull
remote: Counting objects: 48, done.

Install Imagemagick
brew install imagemagick

brew install ghostscript

----
To setup a new tool. (PHYLO)
Use HAV as an example.
Start with the config.xml
copy config.xml and resources.xml to PHYLO

--- config xml --- link to resource HTML, which you edit to get the text wright- to set the pages:
<genotyping-tool>

	</menu>

---- web.xml - have to added a servlet ---


--- blast.xml --- continues if identify the organism (HIV1M)
Need phylos 

---- genome_0.png
Need to be added to folder



---- Summary:
WEB.XML SAY HOW THE tool should be seen in the html


in EACH FOLDER
XML files (config.xml and resources.xml)
CHL-PSO-OMPA (show what should be shown in the results table)

ANALYSIS PART: BLAST.XML
STARTS WITH blast.xml - based on the cluster ID id goes on to look for the phylo.xml file (for clamidia - chim1 - look for phylo-chim1.xml)

Can use to define region (for example influenza of HAV) so it goes by phylo organimsm - region (e.g. HAV phylo-hepatovirus-VP1).

IF PHYLO XML file does not exist it stops there.

PHYLO.XML (e.g. phylo-hiv1M.xml) - phylo major and phylo-minor
Put everything in the XML file that can align that.

-----
Comments: Done HPV. things to do location of the header in the same xml file.
Small sequence (3) is not subtyping.

-----
Comments: Done HHV8 but tree figure is not working in PNG

-----
Comments: Done HTLV-1 - need for all of the new tools to get the size of the genome and the picture...
Need also new alignments.

-----
Need to do HBV

----
HPV2 - failing - undefined cluster alpha15

----
HCV - need to add inside and outside. Difficult to get minor to work (only with few characters). Need to add recombination detection.
Can recombination have a selection before the tool?

----
Dengue - batch results need to have name and not id (do not know how to put this).
Reference sequences need to have genotype in front so tree is easy to interpret.

---- GENERAL COMMENTS
Number of sequences accept. It looks that the limitation is the size of the text file and not the number of sequences.

----
Need to make the fastaToRega to work

----
Need to get the self-bootscan to work

----
Need to be able to export war file so other people can test (maybe a Belgium testing site that I can access by tomcat administrator????)

----
Need to test to see the phylo major and phyo-minor. It was quite confusing on the length of the annotation.

----
Need to code the coronavirus (started, it will be popular)

----
Need to understand how to setup decision trees that involve recombination.

----

2) Phylominor - 
- Prefix - of the minor (1 - 1a, etc). Need to have 

3)Batch output
ID clusters, name, how to change
- RESULT LIST IN CONFIG.XML - Example DENGUE

	<result-list>
		<column>
			<label>Name</label>
			<field>/genotype_result/sequence/@name</field>
		</column>
		<column>
			<label>Length</label>
			<field>/genotype_result/sequence/@length</field>
		</column>
		<column>
			<label>Virus</label>
			<field>/genotype_result/sequence/result[@id='blast']/cluster/concluded-name</field>
		</column>
		<column>
			<label>Phylotype</label>
			<field>/genotype_result/sequence/conclusion/assigned/name</field>
		</column>
		<column>
			<label>Report</label>
			<field>report-link</field>
		</column>
		<column>
			<label>Genome</label>
			<field>genome</field>
		</column>
	</result-list>
	

4) Inside outside rule (?) - XML (?)

5) Report - need to say the classification




6) Recombination 

7) Self-bootstcan

8) Fasta2REGA - new script

9) War file - AINT - info on how to deploy

10) Tomcat server

11) Git for references
