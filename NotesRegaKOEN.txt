Add 



Three examples of tools that can be constructed directly in the XML files (HAV and Nov).

Tulio-MacBook-Pro-Retina:~ tulio$ cd rega-genotype/


Tulio-MacBook-Pro-Retina:rega-genotype tulio$ git pull
remote: Counting objects: 48, done.

Install Imagemagick
brew install imagemagick

brew install ghostscript

----
To setup a new tool. (PHYLO)
Use HAV as an example.
Start with the config.xml
copy config.xml and resources.xml to PHYLO

--- config xml --- link to resource HTML, which you edit to get the text wright- to set the pages:
<genotyping-tool>

	<menu>
		<menu-item>
			<label>How to cite</label>
			<path>how-to-cite</path>
			<message-id>how-to-cite-doc</message-id>
		</menu-item>
		<menu-item>
			<label>Introduction</label>
			<path>introduction</path>

		</menu-item>
	</menu>

---- web.xml - have to added a servlet ---


--- blast.xml --- continues if identify the organism (HIV1M)
Need phylos 

---- genome_0.png
Need to be added to folder



---- Summary:
WEB.XML SAY HOW THE tool should be seen in the html


in EACH FOLDER
XML files (config.xml and resources.xml)
CHL-PSO-OMPA (show what should be shown in the results table)

ANALYSIS PART: BLAST.XML
STARTS WITH blast.xml - based on the cluster ID id goes on to look for the phylo.xml file (for clamidia - chim1 - look for phylo-chim1.xml)

Can use to define region (for example influenza of HAV) so it goes by phylo organimsm - region (e.g. HAV phylo-hepatovirus-VP1).

IF PHYLO XML file does not exist it stops there.

PHYLO.XML (e.g. phylo-hiv1M.xml) - phylo major and phylo-minor
Put everything in the XML file that can align that.

-----
Comments: Done HPV. things to do location of the header in the same xml file.
Small sequence (3) is not subtyping.

-----
Comments: Done HHV8 but tree figure is not working in PNG

-----
Comments: Done HTLV-1 - need for all of the new tools to get the size of the genome and the picture...
Need also new alignments.

-----
Need to do HBV

----
HPV2 - failing - undefined cluster alpha15

----
HCV - need to add inside and outside. Difficult to get minor to work (only with few characters). Need to add recombination detection.
Can recombination have a selection before the tool?
- 1c is failing in the cluster analysis, need to check:
A) PAUP constrain analysis
B) Self-bootscan

Missing clusters:
No 2o 


----
Dengue - batch results need to have name and not id (do not know how to put this).
Reference sequences need to have genotype in front so tree is easy to interpret.

---- GENERAL COMMENTS
Number of sequences accept. It looks that the limitation is the size of the text file and not the number of sequences.

----
Need to make the fastaToRega to work

----
Need to get the self-bootscan to work

----
Need to be able to export war file so other people can test (maybe a Belgium testing site that I can access by tomcat administrator????)

----
Need to test to see the phylo major and phyo-minor. It was quite confusing on the length of the annotation.

----
Need to code the coronavirus (started, it will be popular)

----
Need to understand how to setup decision trees that involve recombination.

----

2) Phylominor - 
- Prefix - of the minor (1 - 1a, etc). Need to have 

3)Batch output
ID clusters, name, how to change
- RESULT LIST IN CONFIG.XML - Example DENGUE

	<result-list>
		<column>
			<label>Name</label>
			<field>/genotype_result/sequence/@name</field>
		</column>
		<column>
			<label>Length</label>
			<field>/genotype_result/sequence/@length</field>
		</column>
		<column>
			<label>Virus</label>
			<field>/genotype_result/sequence/result[@id='blast']/cluster/concluded-name</field>
		</column>
		<column>
			<label>Phylotype</label>
			<field>/genotype_result/sequence/conclusion/assigned/name</field>
		</column>
		<column>
			<label>Report</label>
			<field>report-link</field>
		</column>
		<column>
			<label>Genome</label>
			<field>genome</field>
		</column>

	</result-list>
	

4) Inside outside rule (?) - XML (?)
- You have added as a task to the tool programmer (Mikael).


5) Report - need to say the classification
Done.



6) Recombination 
Generic tool does not current support.


7) Self-bootscan
- We before run from the command line.
Open Genotype tool in eclipse and run command lines
Programme argument - -x xml/dengue rega.genotype.viruses.generic.GenericTool SELF resultDengue2.xml phylo-dengue1.xml 1200 100


8) Fasta2REGA - new script


9) War file - ANT - info on how to deploy


10) Tomcat server
ant 
to redo
ant clean
ant


11) Git for references

	
12) I am not sure of the CONSTRAINS - need to test to make sure it is really implementing as I can see subtypes clustering outside when they should have been constrained. 

13) Wrap paup needed

14) When sequence submitted with same name, add query for the phylo but not for the bootscan

15) need to see why 1c (third sequence) do cluster outside sometimes...
If I delete the third sequence <taxus name="1c_AY651061"/>. I get good classification for E1.
