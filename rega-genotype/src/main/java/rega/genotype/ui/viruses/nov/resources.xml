		<title>The Norovirus Automated Genotyping Tool: introduction.</title>
		<introduction-text>
			<text>
				<p>This typingtool offers quick and unequivocal typing of norovirus sequences.</p>
				<p>
					The tool makes use of a regularly updated set of reference sequences. Timely availability of newly 
					circulating strains enables timely comparison of sequences found in different labs and thus early 
					recognition of globally emerging strains or indications of common sources.<br />
					By issuing preliminary names for new strains and using a standardized nomenclature findings in 
					different parts of the world can be compared.				
				</p>
				<p>
					With this tool sequences of any part of the Norovirus (NoV) genome can be assigned to a NoV genogroup, 
					and sequences of all commonly used regions for typing can be assigned to a genotype.<br />
					For one specific NoV genotype (II.4) the variant of that genotype is determined.<br />
					Sequences of other Caliciviridae are also recognized by the tool and are assigned to their (preliminary) genus. In case of Sapoviruses also a genogroup is assigned.				
				</p>
				<p>
					The sequences used as references in this tool originate from:<br />
					The Foodborne viruses in Europe <a href="http://www.fbve.nl"></a> network and 
					<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank">Genbank</a>	
				</p>
				<p>
					The standardized nomenclature has been drafted by <a href="http://www.noronet.nl">NoroNet</a>

          <p>
        One or more (up to 10.000 per run) NoV sequences can be pasted (A) or
        uploaded (B) in Fasta format (see fig. 1). Sequences of all regions of
        the NoV genome can be used.<br />
        When pasting a single sequence the Identifier of the sequence
        (&gt;Sequencename) should be included (Fasta format).<br />
        One example sequence is present as a default. A set of three <a href="http://www.rivm.nl/mpf/norovirus/typingtool#/examples">
        example sequences</a> is also available.
        </p>

        <div class="centerimage">

          <div class="pic-label">The startingpage of the NoV typingtool</div>
        </div>

        <p>
        The analysis takes up to a few seconds per sequence. Thus, for large
        batches the run can be viewed later, by typing the Job-Id at C. Here
        also runs by others can be viewed, if the Job-Id has been communicated.<br />
        Runs are kept on the server for 1 week. </p>

        <div>
          <img src="../pics/overview.jpg" />
          <div class="pic-label">Overview of the results</div>
        </div>

        <p>
        As soon as the &apos;Start&apos; button is pushed the results overview is shown.
        While the analysis is still in progress the following message is
        displayed:</p>
        
        <p>&apos;Analysis in progress... (Showing partial results). This page
        will be automatically updated every 5 seconds...&apos;.<br /><br />
        The Job Id number, which can be used to retrieve the results later is
        displayed at the top of the page as soon as the job is started.</p>
        
        <p>For each sequence the lenth, positioning on the NoV genome and
        assigned genotype is dtermined. Depending on the positioning of
        the sequence on the NoV genome a
        genogroup and genotype is assigned using a set of ORF1 and/or ORF2
        reference sequences. For sequences of genotype II.4 subsequently a
        subclustering analysis is performed.<br />
        After the complete analysis is finished the analysis results can be
        downloaded as XML, CSV or Excel file. </p>

        <p>
        For each sequence more details can de viewed in the individual reports
        by clicking on &apos;<span class="bold">report</span>&apos; in
        the results table.<br />
        The report of the genotyping details per sequence contains a brief
        overview of the assignment, followed by details of up to four
        phylogenetic analyses including phylogenetic trees, depending on the
        length and positioning, and on the assigned genotype of the input
        sequence. </p>

        <p>The report contains information on: </p>

        <ul style="text-align: left;">
          <li>The sequence submitted (name and length)</li>
          <li>The genus and/or genogroup of the submitted sequence</li>
          <li>The genotype assignment for ORF1 and ORF2 (if &gt;100
        nt overlap)</li>
          <li>The variant within this genotype to which the sequence is assigned</li>
          <li>The robustness of the assignment using bootstrap values.
        Only with bootstrap &gt; 70 a genotype or variant is assigned </li>

          <li>The alignment can be downloaded in NEXUS or FASTA format</li>
        </ul><br />

        <p>
        The genogroup (or the genus) and the localisation on the genome can be determined for
        sequences of any part of the genome.<br />
        For subsequent genotyping the sequence has to overlap at least 100 nt
        with 800 nt at the 3&apos; end of ORF1, which encodes for the polymerase, or
        at least 100 nt with the entire ORF 2 gene, encoding the capsid protein.<br />
        The genotyping region supported by this tool includes all regions (A to
        E) which are used for genotyping by different groups. </p><br />

        <p>No genotype is assigned if:</p>

          <li>The submitted sequence does not overlap &gt; 100 bp with either the ORF2 gene or the supported region

				<b>The genotyping process consists of up to three steps:</b>
				<ol style="text-align: left;">
					<li>The initial step performs an amino-acid blast scan to identify the genogroup and the
					approximate regions covered by the fragment. The submitted sequence is blasted against a
					set of 6 whole genome sequences (Genbank:
					<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=nuccore&amp;id=106060735">NC_001959</a>,

					<div>Schematic representation of genomic regions of NoV used for genotyping, adapted from:
					Vinje J, Hamidjaja RA, Sobsey MD. Development and application of a capsid VP1 (region D) based
					reverse transcription PCR assay for genotyping of genogroup I and II noroviruses.
					J Virol Methods 2004; 116(2):109-17.</div>
					</div>	

					The numbering is relative to the NC_001959 genome.
					</li>
				    <li><p>For Genogroups I and II, for each region (ORF1 fragment or ORF2) supported by tool,
				    that overlaps sufficiently with the submitted sequence, a phylogenetic tree is constructed
				    using the HKY85<span class="cite">1</span> method in the PAUP*<span class="cite">2</span> software.
				    The alignment contains the sequence together with reference sequences for each genotype.
				    Also a bootstrap tree is computed using 100 replicates, presented in the PAUP* log file.
				    For each genotype two representative sequences have been selected, representing the level
				    of variance within the cluster. One of these sequences is usually the official reference strain,
				    while the other sequence is a more contemporary strain.</p>
				    <p>A successful assigment requires a bootstrap value over 70.</p>
				    </li>
				    <li><p>When a genotype II.4 could be identified, a second analysis is done with several sequences
				    of that genotype to identify a specific variant. The same phylogenetic method is used as in
				    step 2, using again 2 representative strains per subcluster.</p>
				    <p>For particular genotypes in ORF1, a second analysis is done with several sequences of that
				    genotype that represent a sub-cluster with a likely capside variant.</p></li>
