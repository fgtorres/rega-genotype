Generic typing tool config file:
Generic typing tool xml files moved out from the project. So every user can
configure his generic tool.
Create a typing tool:
1. create xml folder for the typing tool and place blast.fasta, blast.xml, 
config.xml, resources.xml file in the folder.
2. create a job folder.
3. create config file and place it in {path rega-genotype}/rega-genotype/rega-genotype
config format (json):

	path: "spn", // the url component of the new typing
  tool version: "1.1", 
  configuration: "path to the xml folder",	
  jobDir: "path to job folder",
  auto-update: "true" 
}
]
See config-example for more info on the config file
4. Run typing tool on url
{host-name}/rega-genotype/typingtool/{path}
